# Linear Regression Insurance Model

This project uses linear regression to predict insurance costs based on various features such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoking habits, and region.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model to estimate insurance charges for individuals based on personal attributes. The model is implemented using Python and the scikit-learn library.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model contains information on the following attributes:
- **Age**: The age of the individual.
- **Sex**: The gender of the individual.
- **BMI**: Body mass index.
- **Children**: Number of children/dependents.
- **Smoker**: Whether the individual is a smoker (yes/no).
- **Region**: The geographical region of the individual.
- **Charges**: The insurance charges (target variable).

## Libraries and Dependencies

The following Python libraries are used in this project:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `scikit-learn`: For building and evaluating the linear regression model.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.
